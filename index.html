<h4>Coming From a Life as an Entrepreneur, and a Bachelor in Economics, Now I Aim to Become a Developer.</h4> 
<hr>
<h2 id="About me">About me</h2>
<p>I've always been the shy kid with great logical and analytical skills, but as a teen I ran from IT and joined a <b> Business Management</b> tech shool. From there I followed an administrative path. <br>
<br> Gladly I realized this was not the path for me, and I can tell that I love solving problems and I love everything I've seen in my path into becoming a Dev so far. <br> 
<br> My Goal is joining to become a<b> Data Scientist</b>, but as a complete beginner in this world, I thought it would be wise to start my new path through <strong>Web Development</strong>.
